This program demonstrates the Monty Hall problem.

The Monty Hall prolem goes like this:

You are a contestant on a game show. The game you are playing is simple. There are three doors. Behind one of the doors is a shiny new sport's car. Behind each of the other two doors is a goat. The host asks you to pick: "door one, door two or door three?" Let's suppose you pick door one, but before it's opened, the host will open another door. Knowing which door the car is truly behind, the host opens door three revealing one of the two goats. "Now", says the host,"There are still two doors closed. The car is either behind door one - which you have chosen - or door two. Before we open another door, I'm going to give you a chance now to change from door one to door two. It's completely up to you!"

Sould you switch doors or should you stay with your original choice (in this case door one)? At first glance the problem seems simple. There are two doors remaining, the chance of choosing right should be 50/50 right? Well...not exactly.

This program will demostrate that, in the long run, you are better off switching. You, in fact, have a better than 50/50 chance if you switch doors after the host reveals the first goat. But why?
